Q1. What are conditional statements? Explain conditional statements with syntax and examples.


In JavaScript, conditional statements are used to control the flow of the program based on specified conditions. The primary conditional statements in JavaScript are the if, else if, and else statements.
1. If Statement:
Syntax:
if (condition) {
    // code block to execute if the condition is true
}
Example:
javascript
Copy code
let x = 10;

if (x > 5) {
    console.log("x is greater than 5");
}
In this example, if the value of x is greater than 5, the code block inside the if statement will be executed.

2. If-Else Statement:
Syntax:
if (condition) {
    // code block to execute if the condition is true
} else {
    // code block to execute if the condition is false
}
Example:
let x = 3;

if (x > 5) {
    console.log("x is greater than 5");
} else {
    console.log("x is not greater than 5");
}
If the value of x is not greater than 5, the code block inside the else statement will be executed.

3. If-Else If-Else Statement:
Syntax:
if (condition1) {
    // code block to execute if condition1 is true
} else if (condition2) {
    // code block to execute if condition2 is true
} else {
    // code block to execute if none of the conditions is true
}
Example:
let time = 14;

if (time < 12) {
    console.log("Good morning!");
} else if (time < 18) {
    console.log("Good afternoon!");
} else {
    console.log("Good evening!");
}
In this example, different greetings are printed based on the value of the time variable.

Conditional statements in JavaScript provide a way to create dynamic and responsive code by allowing different code blocks to be executed based on varying conditions within the program.
