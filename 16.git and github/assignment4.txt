Q4.Briefly explain what GitHub is and how it facilitates collaboration and version control also name some alternatives to GitHub.


GitHub is a cloud-based hosting service that helps developer store and manage their code, as well
as track and control changes to their code over time. It also provides a number of features that make it easy for
teams to collaborate on software projects.

GitHub facilitates collaboration and version control in the following ways:

1.Version control: GitHub uses Git, a distributed version control system, to track changes to code.This allows developers to see 
who made what changes and when , to revert to previous versions of the code if necessary.

2.Branches and pull requests: GitHub makes it easy for developers to create and manage branches of their code. this allows developers to 
work on new features or fix bugs without affecting the main codebase.Once a developer is ready to merge their changes back into the main 
codebase, they can create a pull request.This allows others developers to review the changes and provide feedback before they are merged.

3.Issues and tasks: Githib provides a way for developers to track issues and tasks issues related to their code. This  helps teams to stay 
organized and to prioritize their work.

4.discussions: Githib provides a way for developers to discuss their code and ask questions. This helps to promote collaboration and 
knowledge sharing.
