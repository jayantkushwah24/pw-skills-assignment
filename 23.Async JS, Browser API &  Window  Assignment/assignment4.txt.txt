Q4.Compare Promises to callbacks and discuss why Promises are preferred for managing asynchronous
code.


Promises and callbacks are both mechanisms used in JavaScript for managing asynchronous code execution. However, Promises offer several advantages over traditional callbacks, making them a preferred choice in many cases. Let's compare the two:

Handling Asynchronous Operations:

Callbacks: With callbacks, asynchronous operations are managed by passing functions as arguments to other functions. This can lead to deeply nested callback structures, commonly referred to as "callback hell," which can make code difficult to read and maintain.
Promises: Promises provide a cleaner and more structured way to handle asynchronous operations. They represent a future value or event and allow you to chain multiple asynchronous operations together using .then() and .catch() methods, resulting in more readable and maintainable code.
Error Handling:

Callbacks: Error handling in callback-based code can become cumbersome, especially when dealing with nested callbacks. Errors are typically handled through conditional statements within the callback functions, leading to verbose and error-prone code.
Promises: Promises offer built-in error handling through the .catch() method, which allows you to handle errors in a centralized manner at the end of the promise chain. This leads to cleaner and more concise error handling code.
Composition:

Callbacks: Callback-based code can be challenging to compose and combine, especially when dealing with multiple asynchronous operations that depend on each other. This often results in "callback pyramids" or deeply nested callback structures, making the code difficult to understand and maintain.
Promises: Promises support composition through chaining, allowing you to easily sequence multiple asynchronous operations together. This results in code that is more modular, composable, and easier to reason about.
Readability and Maintainability:

Callbacks: Callback-based code can quickly become unreadable and difficult to maintain, especially as the number of nested callbacks grows. This can lead to code that is hard to understand, debug, and extend.
Promises: Promises promote cleaner, more readable, and maintainable code by providing a structured way to handle asynchronous operations. The use of method chaining and built-in error handling improves code clarity and reduces the likelihood of introducing bugs.
Promise.all() and Promise.race():

Promises: Promises offer additional utility methods like Promise.all() and Promise.race() for handling multiple promises simultaneously. Promise.all() waits for all promises to resolve, while Promise.race() waits for the first promise to resolve or reject. These methods simplify handling complex asynchronous scenarios that involve multiple asynchronous operations.
Overall, Promises offer a more elegant and robust solution for managing asynchronous code compared to traditional callbacks. They address many of the pain points associated with callback-based code, such as callback hell, error handling, composition, readability, and maintainability. As a result, Promises are generally preferred for managing asynchronous code in modern JavaScript applications.
