Q3. Differentiate between unary, binary, and ternary operators in JavaScript. Give examples of each.

 The classification of operators in JavaScript is based on the number of operands they work with. Here's the differentiation between unary, binary, and ternary operators along with examples:

Unary Operators:

Definition: Unary operators operate on a single operand.
Example:

let num = 5;
console.log(-num);   // Unary negation
console.log(++num);  // Increment
console.log(--num);  // Decrement
Binary Operators:

Definition: Binary operators work with two operands.
Example:

let x = 10;
let y = 5;

console.log(x + y);  // Addition
console.log(x - y);  // Subtraction
console.log(x * y);  // Multiplication
console.log(x / y);  // Division
Ternary Operator:

Definition: The ternary operator is the only ternary operator in JavaScript, and it takes three operands.
Syntax:

condition ? expressionIfTrue : expressionIfFalse;
Example:
javascript
Copy code
let age = 20;
let message = (age >= 18) ? "Adult" : "Minor";
In the ternary operator example, the condition (age >= 18) is evaluated. If it is true, the expression before the : (in this case, "Adult") is returned; otherwise, the expression after the : (in this case, "Minor") is returned.

Understanding the number of operands an operator works with is crucial for using them correctly in expressions and statements within your JavaScript code.
