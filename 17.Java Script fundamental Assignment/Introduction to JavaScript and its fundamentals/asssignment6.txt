Question 6: Explain the importance of choosing meaningful and descriptive variable names in JavaScript.
Provide an example where using a clear identifier improves code readability.

Choosing meaningful and descriptive variable names in JavaScript is crucial for several reasons:

Readability: Clear and descriptive variable names make your code more readable and understandable for yourself and others. It reduces the need for extensive comments to explain the purpose of each variable.

Maintainability: When you or others revisit the code later, meaningful variable names make it easier to understand the logic and make modifications. It contributes to the maintainability of the codebase.

Collaboration: In a collaborative environment, meaningful variable names facilitate communication among team members. It helps team members quickly grasp the purpose of different variables and functions.

Reduced Errors: Descriptive variable names reduce the likelihood of errors. When variables are named according to their purpose, it's less likely that you'll use them incorrectly or misunderstand their intended usage.

Example:
Consider the following code snippet with poorly chosen variable names:


let x = 10;
let y = 5;

let z = x + y;

console.log(z);
Now, compare it to a version with meaningful variable names:


let firstNumber = 10;
let secondNumber = 5;

let sum = firstNumber + secondNumber;

console.log(sum);
In the second example, it's immediately clear that firstNumber and secondNumber are being added to calculate the sum. This makes the code more self-explanatory and reduces the cognitive load when reading or maintaining the code.

By consistently choosing meaningful and descriptive variable names, you contribute to the overall readability and maintainability of your JavaScript code.
