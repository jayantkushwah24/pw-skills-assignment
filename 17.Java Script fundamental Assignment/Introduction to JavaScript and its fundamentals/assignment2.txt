Explain the key differences between JavaScript and HTML. Provide examples of situations where
you would use each.


JavaScript and HTML are both essential technologies in web development, but they serve different purposes.

HTML (Hypertext Markup Language):

HTML is a markup language used for structuring content on the web.
It provides the basic building blocks of a web page, defining elements like headings, paragraphs, images, links, and more.
HTML is static, meaning it creates the structure and layout of a webpage but doesn't handle dynamic behavior or interactivity.
Example:
html

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>My Web Page</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
    <p>This is a simple web page.</p>
    <img src="example.jpg" alt="An example image">
</body>
</html>
JavaScript:

JavaScript is a programming language that adds interactivity and dynamic behavior to web pages.
It runs on the client side, allowing developers to manipulate the content, respond to user actions, and update the page without a full reload.
JavaScript is used for tasks like form validation, creating animations, handling user input, and making asynchronous requests to servers.
Example:
html

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Interactive Web Page</title>
    <script>
        function greet() {
            var name = prompt("What's your name?");
            alert("Hello, " + name + "!");
        }
    </script>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Welcome to the Interactive Web Page</h1>
    <button onclick="greet()">Say Hello</button>
</body>
</html>
In this example, HTML sets up the structure of the page, while JavaScript adds interactivity by prompting the user for their name and displaying a personalized greeting.

So, in summary, HTML is for structuring content, while JavaScript is for adding behavior and interactivity to that content. They often work together to create dynamic and engaging web experiences.
