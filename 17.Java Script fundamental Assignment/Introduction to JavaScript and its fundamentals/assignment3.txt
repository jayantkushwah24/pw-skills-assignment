Question 3: List and describe the five primitive data types in JavaScript.

In JavaScript, there are five primitive data types. Here they are, along with brief descriptions:

Number:
Represents numeric data, including integers and floating-point numbers.
Example: let age = 25;

String:
Represents textual data, enclosed in single or double quotes.
Example: let name = "John";

Boolean:
Represents a logical value, either true or false.
Used for logical operations and conditional statements.
Example: let isStudent = true;

Undefined:
Represents a variable that has been declared but not assigned a value.
Example: let salary;

Null:
Represents the intentional absence of any object value.
It is often used to indicate that a variable has no value or that a function returns no value.
Example: let user = null;
These primitive data types are the building blocks for more complex data structures and are used to store and manipulate basic values in JavaScript programs.
