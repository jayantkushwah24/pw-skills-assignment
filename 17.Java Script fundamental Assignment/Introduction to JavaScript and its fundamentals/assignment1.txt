Question 1: Explain what JavaScript is and its role in web development.

JavaScript is a versatile programming language that's primarily used for
 making websites interactive. It's a key component in web development, 
 allowing developers to add dynamic elements, handle user input, and update 
 content without needing to reload the entire page. JavaScript can be used 
 on both the client side (running in the user's browser) and the server side
  (running on the web server). It plays a crucial role in creating modern, 
  responsive, and user-friendly web applications. So, whether it's validating 
  forms, creating animations, or fetching data from a server, JavaScript is 
  the go-to language for many web developers.
